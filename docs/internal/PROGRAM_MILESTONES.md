# PatchMaster Program Milestones

## Milestone Status

### M1 — Global Tracing + Error Envelope
Status: Completed

Scope delivered:
- Request tracing middleware across API surface (`X-Request-ID`, `X-Trace-Token`)

  - Unhandled server exceptions
- Correlation-friendly payload fields:
  - `request_id`
  - `trace_token`
  - structured `error` object

Primary implementation:
- `backend/main.py`

Acceptance outcome:
- API responses include trace headers.
- Error responses are diagnosable and consistent across endpoints.

- Central queue module for long-running tasks:
  - enqueue
  - worker execution
  - status tracking
  - cancel pending jobs
- Queue API:
  - `GET /api/ops-queue/jobs`
  - `GET /api/ops-queue/jobs/{job_id}`
  - `POST /api/ops-queue/jobs/{job_id}/cancel`
- Startup worker initialization in backend app lifecycle.

Integrated backend domains:
- Mirror sync / retention / bootstrap
- Backups run
- Bulk patch run
- Testing run
- Report generation

Primary implementation:
- `backend/api/ops_queue.py`
- integration in `backend/main.py`
- integration updates in:
  - `backend/api/mirror_repos.py`
  - `backend/api/backups.py`
  - `backend/api/bulk_patch.py`
  - `backend/api/testing.py`
  - `backend/api/reports.py`

Acceptance outcome:
- Heavy operations now share one backend control plane and consistent job model.

### M3 — Unified Operations Queue UI + Cross-Module Auto-Jump
Status: Completed

Scope delivered:
- New Operations Queue frontend dashboard:
  - queue list
  - status filter
  - job detail
  - cancel pending
  - copy diagnostics JSON
- Navigation entry and route integration.
- Cross-module auto-jump to queue detail after operation submit:
  - backups
  - bulk patch
  - testing
  - mirror sync/retention
  - report generation

Primary implementation:
- `frontend/src/OpsQueuePage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/App.js`
- module connectors:
  - `frontend/src/BackupManagerPage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/BulkPatchPage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/TestingPage.js`
  - `frontend/src/MirrorRepoOpsPage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/ReportsOpsPage.jsx`

Acceptance outcome:
- Operators can submit and immediately monitor operations from one queue workspace.

  - run rejection endpoint
  - resume-on-approval queue handoff
- Explicit gate decision log on ring run summaries
- Policy audit trail API and UI view
